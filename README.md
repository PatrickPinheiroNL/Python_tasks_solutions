Hello! Nice to meet you! My name is Patrick, and I'm 25 years old. I study Computer Science at Estácio de Sá University and live in Rio de Janeiro.

If you're interested in discussing job opportunities, programming, Python, or collaborating on new projects, please feel free to reach out on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-freitas-pinheiro/.

I created this new repository to share my projects and new learnings using Python. 
I will post 100 projects until the end of my course, and I challenge you to try to solve these projects with me so that we can evolve together. These projects range from basic to advanced.

How does it work?

You will find a folder with the name of the program that contains 2 files: 1 explaining the task and 1 with the solution, outlining all the necessary details to complete
the challenge.
