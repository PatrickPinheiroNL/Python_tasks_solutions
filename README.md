Hello! Nice to meet you! My name is Patrick, and I'm 24 years old. I study Computer Science at Estácio de Sá University and live in Rio de Janeiro.

If you're interested in discussing job opportunities, programming, Python, or collaborating on new projects, please feel free to reach out on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-freitas-pinheiro/.

I created this new repository to share my projects and new learnings using Python. 
I will post 100 projects until the end of my course, and I challenge you to try to solve these projects with me so that we can evolve together. These projects range from basic to advanced.

How does it work?

In each task, you will find two files with matching names. For instance, you might encounter files named First_Task and First_Solution. The First_Task file contains the problem that needs to be solved, outlining all the necessary details to complete
the challenge. Upon finishing the challenge, the First_Solution file will give the solution to that problem.
